The goal of this project is to build a Document retrieval engine where a user uploads a document and a set of relevant documents will be retrieved from the database. We will convert all the documents available in the repository to embeddings(document-level embeddings). We will create a search index for all the embeddings using Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS).Â  When a query/document is given as input, it will be converted to an embedding and it will be used for similarity search. Once a user uploads a pdf, the input details related to pdf are posted to the application via REST API, and after processing at backend, similar pdfs are displayed for the user.

Software:

Python Flask
Docker
React
AWS S3
Grobid(GeneRation Of BIbliographic Data.)
SPECTER (Transformer based NLP model)
Facebook AI Similarity Search 
Kubernetes
Firebase











# Final Project Repository

You need to provide us access to your code repository.

If you did not use a github repository during your development, you can simply copy your files into this repository and commit those files as you would normally do.

If you already used a git repository, you can add this repository as an extra "remote" repository. For example, lets say that your final-project repository that you checked out through Github Classroom is `final-project-xyzzy`. You would execute the following steps:

```
$ git remote add final-project git@github.com:cu-csci-4253-datacenter-fall-2021/final-project-xyzzy.git

$ git push -u final-project main
Enter passphrase for key '/Users/grunwald/.ssh/id_rsa':

 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'final-project'.
```

Note that this example uses branch `main` as the main branch; older git repos would use the branch `master`. This example also assumes you're using SSH-based authentication.

You can add this remote repository link right away and then continue to push updated to it using the the `git push final-project main` command. For more details on using multiple remote repoositories [see the documenation](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes).
